# Credit Scoring Model 🏦

This project builds a machine learning model to predict credit approval using the Australian Credit Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Financial institutions need to determine whether a customer is creditworthy before approving loans or credit. This project aims to automate that decision using a supervised machine learning model.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository  
- **Name:** Australian Credit Approval  
- **Rows:** 690  
- **Features:** 14 (`A1` to `A14`)  
- **Target:** `Class` (0 = Rejected, 1 = Approved)
